# Basic-Python-Exercises

#### Function practice problems. For the following problems, I'm looking for functions that accomplish the tasks described. Questions 3-5 are on codewars

-  Takes in a list as an argument and returns the the highest value in the list. You can assume all elements in the list will be either floats or integers. 
Example:
``` python 
highest_value([5,343,56.4,1454,-23, -4000])
// should return 1454
```

-  Takes in a string as a argument and returns the string "contains r" if the string actually contains the letter 'r' - the function should return "Does not contain r" if the string doesn't contain the letter. 
Example:
``` python 
contains_r("Here is an example input string")
// should return "contains r"
```

-  [Reversed words](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51c8991dee245d7ddf00000e) Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.
Example: 

``` python 
reverseWords("The greatest victory is that which requires no battle")
// should return "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"
```
-  [Remove spaces of strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57eae20f5500ad98e50002c5) Remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.
